# RunLog

Logging your runs and view useful statistics.
The goal of this app is to have an as easy-to-use as possible app which
saves your runs.

Current implementation:
- starts/pauses as you move
- shows mean of last 10 measurements and means over all

Future features:
- add graphs with speed
- store and retrieve logs
- download/upload logs using a web-interface
  - connect to your device using danu, of course!
- use hear-rate monitor

## Current Bugs

- seems to calculate the distance wrong when compared with other apps

## Motivation

The apps I know don't create nice statistics:
- Google Fit makes them too small
- Runtastic has an awful filter which distorts the runs

## Changelog

2025-05-19:
